# README

This directory is for unit testing and machine learning purposes. With enough samples, [`ztsd`](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/#small-data) should be able to create a dictionary that can be embedded in `xxdd` which reduces the payload size. Alternatively, [huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding), [VLQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity), or something else clever could be used.
